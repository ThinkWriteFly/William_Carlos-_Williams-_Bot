	 the fish
	 that were under
	 the bowl

	 I have slept
	 the bacteria
	 that were above

	 Forgive me 
	 they were Elated
	 so Gifted
	 and so Stormy

	 I have felt
	 the focuses
	 that were under
	 the trash bin
 
	 and which 
	 you were probably
	 saving
 
	 for brunch

	 Forgive me 
	 they were Unsightly
	 so Bewildered
	 and so Odd

	 I have led
	 the appendices
	 that were above
	 the depository
 
	 and which 
	 you were probably
	 saving
 
	 for dinner

	 Forgive me 
	 they were Exuberant
	 so Lively
	 and so Inquisitive
